ZX-Uno @ MEGA65: ZX Spectrum Core
=================================

This MEGA65 Core is based on Miguel Angel Rodriguez Jodar's great
[ZX-Uno](https://zxuno.speccy.org/index_e.shtml). It was ported to the MEGA65
in 2020/21 by [sy2002](http://sy2002.de). The ZX Spectrum is quite a machine!
For sure not self-explanatory for beginners and the core does need a specially
prepared SD card, so do not miss the
[Getting Started](https://github.com/sy2002/zxuno4mega65/wiki/Getting-Started)
tutorial.
