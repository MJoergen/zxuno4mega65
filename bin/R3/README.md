### "Core does not start" bugfix (experimental)

In case you experience the "ambulance light" problem or other problems
when it comes to starting the ZX Uno Core, then use
`ZXUNO4M65-MAX10-fix.cor`
and `ZXUNO4M65-MAX10-fix.bit`.

MEGA65's reset button is disabled in this experimental core.

Caution: Only use this experimental version in case you experience problems
while starting the core. Otherwise stick with the official release.
